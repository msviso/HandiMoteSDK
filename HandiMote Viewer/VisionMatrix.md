# Introduction to Using the Vision Data Matrix

Our vision data matrix is 24x20 pixels in size, with each pixel represented by 8 bits (1 byte). This matrix includes data for the user's five fingers in a fixed position relative to the user's palm. Below is an explanation of how to interpret and use this data.

## Vision Data Matrix Structure

1. **Matrix Size**: 24 rows x 20 columns, with each element being 8 bits (1 byte).
2. **Data Representation**: Each element represents a grayscale value of a pixel, ranging from 0 to 255, where 0 indicates black and 255 indicates white.

## Finger Positioning

This matrix contains the data for the user's five fingers, which are distributed in fixed positions within the matrix. The diagram below shows an example of the finger positions within the matrix:

## Usage Steps

1. **Read Matrix Data**: Read the 24x20 data matrix from the device or file.
2. **Parse Data**: Parse each 8-bit data element into a grayscale value.
3. **Identify Finger Positions**: Identify the distribution of grayscale values for each finger based on their fixed positions in the matrix.
4. **Data Application**: Perform corresponding image processing or gesture recognition operations based on the grayscale values.
